                     African elephants are the largest land animals in the world. They are herbivores that live in herds and migrate across 37 African countries. They are known for their trunks, which they use to communicate and handle objects, and their large ears, which help them release excess heat. Adult male African elephants, or bull elephants, can stand up to 3 meters tall and weigh up to 6,000 kilograms. Female elephants are slightly smaller, standing 228–252 centimeters at the shoulder and weighing 2.3–3.1 tons.  
African elephants sleep less than other animals, averaging only two hours of sleep per 24-hour cycle.

                      Jaguars are the third largest cat in the world, after lions and tigers, and the largest cat in the Americas. They can measure five to eight feet from nose to tail, and weigh 140 to 300 pounds. Male jaguars can weigh up to 120 kg, while females can weigh up to 100 kg. However, their size can vary by region, with jaguars in central America being about half the size of those in the Pantanal. 
Jaguars are top predators that use their bulk to take on large prey, such as giant caiman.
